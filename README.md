# Tips
This is a tip calculator I created using the Code Path tutorial. <a href="https://vimeo.com/102084767">Tip Calculator in Swift</a>

The basic tip calculator took about 2 hours, and I spent an additional 2 hours on creating the graphics and layout. 
Required - Basic tip calculator from video walkthrough. Optional - Graphics and layout.
